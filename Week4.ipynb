Finding affordable housing with safe neighborhoods and prefered venues is a big challenge.  Data science can save time for finding and meeting such criteria by providing interactive visual tools through Jupyter notebook.  A Goal of this project is to provide such a sample in San Francisco utilizing  **Folium** library to make visual segmentation and clustering data in a map.  This notebook allows users to tweek few parameters and shows crime rate in neighborhoods, rental price ranges and venues on interactive maps.<br><br>\nThis project can help rentees considering moving to San Francisco or renters deciding reasonable rents since interactive visual aids can quickly allow users to see intuitive and interactive visual infromation. The use of FourSquare data and mapping techniques combined with data analysis will help providing clustered venues along with rents and crime rate in a single map. Lastly, this project is a good practical case toward the development of Data Science skills.<br>"

This notebook will use geojson data from DataSF (https://data.sfgov.org/api/geospatial/pty2-tcw4?method=export&format=GeoJSON) for geographical information and police department incident report from DataSF (https://data.sfgov.org/api/views/wg3w-h783/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD) for crime statistics and finally use python-craigslist to retrieve set of most recent posts on interactive map.  The raw data from craigslist is programatically scraped.  The data will generate statistics and interactive visual aids for users.<br><br>\nUse Foursquare and geopy data to map top 10 venues for all San Francisco neighborhoods and clustered in groups ( as per Course LAB). Use foursquare and geopy data to map the location of available rental housings and crime rates, separately and on top of the above clustered map in order to identify the venues.  The markers of rental housing display the rents and URL to the posts in the popups. Alternatively Boxplot and Choropleth Maps shows rents statistics and average rents respectively to give a general price trend in the neighborhoods. "
